    "# Assignment 3: Programming Part\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, you'll be using PySpark to process tweets, i.e., messages generated on [twitter](http://twitter.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains: (i) instructions to setup the programming environment, and (ii) the programming problems. You will use this notebook to write your code and submit it for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "To run your code, you will need to connect to a Jupyter server maintained by [CSC](https://www.csc.fi/). Please read the following instructions very carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open your browser and go to server address https://86.50.170.119.\n",
    "* If you are asked for credentials, provide **username:** *student* and **password:** *moderndb*.\n",
    "* Once you're in the Jupyter \"Home\" page, **upload** your copy of the notebook by clicking *Upload* on the top-right corner.\n",
    "* You will now see the notebook listed in \"Home\". Click to open it on a new tab and work on the programming problems.\n",
    "* Once you have completed all or part of your work, make sure you **download** the notebook to your computer. You do that by selecting *File > Dowload as > IPython Notebook*. At the end of your session (after you download your notebook), select *File > Close and Halt*.\n",
    "* Submit the notebook that contains your final solutions (code and output) to mycourses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The server will restart after **15 minutes of inaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you have made changes to the notebook but want to pause your work, make sure you **download** the notebook to your computer. You can **upload** it again when you're ready to resume your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do if the server restarts while inactive** \n",
    "To save the code you wrote, copy and paste it manually to a text file on your computer. You can then follow again the *main steps* described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "If you receive a message that says that the server is full, allow 15-20 minutes before you try to access it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention!** You **must** develop and run your code before the day of the deadline. We cannot guarantee support for any failures that happen on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small and large dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with two datasets:\n",
    "* A **small** dataset. This dataset is already available. Its purpose is for you to work with it to develop solutions for the assignment.\n",
    "* A **large** dataset. This dataset will be available on *Friday April 1st, 2016*, together with instructions on how to access it. You will use it to produce your *final solutions* for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PySpark Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following cells once before you start working on your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* If you attempt to create a `SparkContext` twice, you will get an error.\n"
